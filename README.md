## Project
This project analyzes the open-source Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD) supplied by the Knowledge Media Institute at the Open University (https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset). It analyzes performance trends among various cohorts in the sample, prepares features for analysis and builds machine learning models to predict students who are at risk of failure. 

The goal of the analysis is to:
- Conduct a <b>descriptive analysis</b> analyzing trends among various cohorts in the student body.
- Analyze and <b>prepare features</b> from datasets for predictive modelling.
- Build and <b>evaluate predictive machine learning models</b> to predict students who are at risk of failure. 

### Packages Used

- Numpy (https://numpy.org/)
- Seaborn (https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/)
